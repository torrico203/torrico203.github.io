      <h1>Cover Letter</h1>

      <p><strong>To the Google Play Partnerships Team,</strong></p>

      <p>
        I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in the Strategic
        Partnerships Development Manager, Games, Google Play (Korean, English)
        position in Seoul. With 11 years of extensive experience in the gaming
        industry, leading 16 projects from concept to global launch as a PD, PM,
        and PO, I am confident that my proven track record in business
        development, strategic partnerships, and cross-functional leadership
        aligns perfectly with the requirements of this role.
      </p>

      <h2>Driving Growth Through Strategic Partnerships & Business Acumen</h2>
      <p>
        As a co-representative at Zip Lab Co., Ltd. for the past decade, I have
        been at the forefront of business development and partnership management
        within the dynamic gaming sector. My responsibilities included securing
        publishing contracts, orchestrating global game launches, and
        successfully attracting investments. This involved frequent engagement
        with C-level executives and navigating complex negotiations,
        demonstrating my ability to manage critical agreements and foster
        mutually beneficial relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        My experience extends beyond development into the full lifecycle of a
        game startup, including market entry strategies and revenue generation.
        This comprehensive background has equipped me with a deep understanding
        of the mobile games market, its evolving standards, diverse business
        models, and key distribution channels, particularly within the Korean
        ecosystem and globally.
      </p>

      <h2>Cross-functional Leadership & Project Management Excellence</h2>
      <p>
        In my various leadership roles, I have consistently led cross-functional
        teams, managing intricate project timelines and trackers to achieve
        ambitious objectives. From overseeing the development of titles like
        'Seoul Zombie' (500k downloads) and 'Raising a Job Character Online'
        (Chungnam Game Award winner) to managing government-funded technology
        development initiatives, I have honed exceptional project management,
        organization, and collaboration skills. My ability to synthesize
        progress and feedback for diverse stakeholders, both internal and
        external, ensures transparent and effective communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am adept at identifying new technical collaboration opportunities
        between developers and platforms, as evidenced by my work on the 'ROR
        GAME Platform' and various game optimizations (e.g., iOS optimization,
        Addressable/Pooling optimization). I am prepared to lead technical
        discussions, passionately advocate for developer needs, and secure
        commitment from product, engineering, marketing, and commerce teams
        within Google.
      </p>

      <h2>Advocacy, Problem Solving, and Bilingual Communication</h2>
      <p>
        My role has often involved providing business consultations to key
        partners, leveraging performance metrics and market analysis to
        contribute to their growth. This experience, coupled with my strong
        problem-solving skills – demonstrated through system design, UI/UX
        optimization, and overcoming development challenges – positions me to
        effectively identify product gaps and advocate for enhancements that
        drive developer success on Google Play. I am also experienced in
        planning and executing developer events, creating standard procedures to
        scale initiatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fluent in both Korean and English, I am well-prepared to cultivate and
        grow robust partnerships with games developers in Korea, ensuring
        seamless client relationship management and effective communication of
        both technical and financial intricacies with partners and internal
        Google teams.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am highly motivated by Google Play's mission to help partners build
        and grow their businesses, and I am eager to leverage my expertise to
        shape Play's strategy within the vibrant Korean mobile games ecosystem.
        Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to discussing
        how my experience and passion can contribute to your team.
      </p>
